Do not add, delete, or modify files in data folder. These are data for
File::Find::Rex tests that compare results to what's actually contained
in the data folder.

Any modifications to the data folder and it's contents (including
subdirectories, and the contents of the files themselves) will require
updating the test files accordingly.
